# Interesting-Puzzles
Some puzzles which I solved with Python. They were gathered all across the web, so I gave them special repository. Mostly these puzzles require logic and general programming knowledge, as well as algorythms

I will most definitely submit more and more of solved puzzles, so stay tuned!
